# Open Bus
Open Bus is an Open source initiative to be able to serve transit users throughout the world by building and catering effective tools for their convenient transit ride no matter where they live

# Introduction
It is no surprise that using public transit around the world is not straight forward and being prepared or to plan accordingly comes as setback with the available resources. With such issues in mind, Open Bus aims to build community driven tools to help public make the best use of the transit system in their municipality.
